# Flight Finder
This project is used for [American Airlines] workshops. It requires the use of the [American Airlines Flight Engine].

This project is a good way to learn how React.js and servers can work together. It is built using [Next.js], [React.js], and [Typescript].

## Installation
### Download Node.js
Go to https://nodejs.org/ and download the `LTS` version.

> `LTS` = `Long Term Support`

> This is recommended for most users. If you're feeling _extra_, you can get the `Current` version. You can see the new things added in `12.9.1` [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V12.md#12.9.1).

> This will also install the Node Package Manager (`npm`)
